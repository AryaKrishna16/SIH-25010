## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
-Develop a mobile and SMS-based Smart Crop Advisory System that uses AI to recommend suitable crops, detect diseases from plant images, and send real-time weather and market alerts—empowering small and marginal    farmers with personalized, multilingual guidance for better yield and income.
-Works via SMS and voice in regional languages, making it usable even for farmers without smartphones or literacy.
-Farmers can simply snap a photo of a sick plant to get instant diagnosis and treatment suggestions.


## Technical Approach
 Softwares used
- Android Studio – for mobile app development
- Python / Node.js – for backend and AI models
- OpenCV – for image-based disease detection
- Firebase / AWS – for cloud storage and notifications
- Twilio / Textlocal – for SMS alerts
- Google Maps API – for location-based crop advice
 Hardwares used
- Smartphones / Feature Phones – for farmer access
- Basic Soil Testing Kits – to collect soil data

  FLOWCHART

  1. Farmer Registration
   └─ Sends SMS to system number or gets registered by agent

2. Crop Information Submission
   └─ Sends crop type, location, and growth stage via SMS

3. System Analysis
   └─ Uses AI and weather data to generate advice

4. Advisory Message Sent
   └─ Farmer receives SMS with tips (watering, pest control, etc.)

5. Farmer Applies Advice
   └─ Follows instructions in the field

6. Feedback or Query
   └─ Sends follow-up SMS for help or updates

7. Regular Updates
   └─ Receives weekly tips, weather alerts, and market info




## Feasibility and Viability
 Feasibility -these systems use technology like AI, weather data, and soil sensors to give farmers personalized advice—helping them choose the right crops, manage pests, and optimize irrigation.
 Viability -not all farmers have smartphones or internet access, some may not trust tech-based advice, and rural areas often lack the infrastructure to support these systems fully.
 To overcome the risks :
             Training & Awareness-Conduct village-level workshops and demo sessions to build digital literacy and confidence in tech-based advice.
